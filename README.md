# Desktop Notes
Utility that draws text on top of the desktop wallpaper but behind the icons. Useful for placing persistent notes. **Does not work correctly via remote desktop and therefore RDS Servers recommend the WPF version is used instead https://github.com/tofuman0/Desktop-Notes-WPF**

## Credits
The code for drawing to desktop is from: Gerald Degeneve - https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/856020/Draw-Behind-Desktop-Icons-in-Windows-plus
